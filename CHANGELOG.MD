All releases are in both IPS and BPS format!  They require a BPS and/or IPS patcher such as 'Floating IPS' to use.
You only need ONE of them (not both) depending on which format you want to use!
You apply the patch to the original Japanese ROM of Phantasy Star 1.
You are responsible for providing your own compatible ROM file!

For the sake of convenience, I have a compiled binary of the latest release of 'Floating IPS' over on my other repository.

# CHANGELOG

**v2.2 - Daedalus Edition**
16 January 2021

    -Altered script to uncensor all acts of 'killing' someone.
        Replaced words like 'stop', 'destroy', 'defeat', and so forth with 'kill' and equivalents.
            Also made 'Shadow Warrior' and Lord LaShiec's dialogue slightly more menacing/cruel/taunting.
               You can review the commits for specific alteration details.
    -Updated menus.yaml to change 'Stats' to 'Status'.
    -Slightly changed dialogue for Pharmacy and Armory shops so that the respective clerks ask a Yes/No question to match the prompts.
    -Changed dialogue for Shops, Hospital, and Church to be more polite.
    -Changed 'God' to 'Goddess'.
    -Fixed an NPC mentioning IceDriller to Ice Driller

What Changed and Why?

    Perseus Shield is shorter than Shield of Perseus.
    FlowMover sounds 'Engrish' so changed it back to Hover Craft.
    IceDecker also sounds 'Engrish' so changed to Ice Driller.
    Smoke Bomb sounds more ninja/stealthy than Escape Cloth.
    Master Key makes more sense to me than Miracle Key since no 'miracle' is performed.  It's just a key!
    Change both PelorieMate and Ruoginin to Mono/Di Mate as a nod to later Phantasy Star games.
    Flashlight makes more sense to me than Searchlight.
    TranCarpet sounds 'Engrish' so changed to the more sci-fi Transporter instead.
    Change Bind to Ensnare also makes more sense to me when 'webbed' by certain enemies.
    Change Bypass to Egress with a more suitable English meaning and referencing Shining in the Darkness.
    I prefer Magic Unlock over Magic Unseal with a nod to 'Unlock Magic' from Ultima games.
    Magic Waller sounds Engrish so shortened to Magic Wall.  I debated on Shell from Final Fantasy but changed mind.
         Changed Magic Wall to Mighty Wall to contrast with Basic Wall and to avoid issues with confusing names.
    Escape is both more succinct and understandable in English to not confuse Quick Dash as a buff.
    I changed Super Heal to Mega Heal as a personal nitpick.
    Transrate looks like a typo and it was done on purpose (check translation notes).  Construe does the job better IMHO.
    Troop is a substandard localization IMHO.  I used Teleport to also match the French version.
    Untrap is fine but Disarm Trap gives better nods to D&D and RPG vernacular.
    Waller changed to Protect Wall because Final Fantasy uses 'Protect' against physical damage.
         Changed Protect Wall to Basic Wall to contrast with Mighty Wall and avoid issues with confusing names.
    Wind is ok but boring.  Tornado sounds like an actual destructive force!
